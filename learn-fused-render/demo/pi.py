"""Estimate pi by throwing darts — a runPython target. Stdlib only.

Throw n random darts into the unit square and count how many land inside the
quarter circle of radius 1. The fraction inside is pi/4, so pi ~= 4 * inside/n.
The whole point of the demo: a slider changes n, and real local Python throws
the darts and recomputes the estimate every time.
